# StocksV2

The code base is designed Zack, Garrett, Thomas and Maui which fetches real-time stock data through an API and allows users to practice buying and selling stocks using virtual money. The user interface allows users to search for and select stocks, view their current market value and recent trends, and place buy and sell orders. The virtual money is used to simulate the real stock market without any financial risk to the users. The code base is designed with scalability in mind, and new features can be easily added to enhance the user experience. The code base is built using modern web technologies and follows best practices for security and performance.
